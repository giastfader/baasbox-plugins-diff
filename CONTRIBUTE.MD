If you have found this project useful and want to enhance it, you are welcome!

Of course there is plenty of space to improve these simple scripts I have wrote in hurry because I needed them.

I only ask you to follow the following steps:

*  open an issue and let's discuss it
*  submit a PR against the develop branch 

Thank you!
